# toDoApp

A simple, lightweight to-do application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to create, mark as complete, and delete tasks, with data persistence through local storage.

This is my second iteration of a to-do application, featuring a cleaner code organization, more elegant design, and improved performance. This version uses a smarter approach with clearer logic and less code, while maintaining a beautiful, minimalist interface.

## Features

- **Create tasks** with a simple input field
- **Mark tasks as complete** with a visual strikethrough effect
- **Delete tasks** you no longer need
- **Data persistence** through localStorage
- **Responsive design** that works on multiple screen sizes
